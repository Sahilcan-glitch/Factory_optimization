## üìö University Project: Reasoning and Decision Making Under Uncertainty

This project is a comprehensive study undertaken as part of the **Reasoning and Decision Making Under Uncertainty** course at [Your University Name]. The primary objective is to optimize factory machinery operations to **maximize production** while **minimizing harmful emissions**. Leveraging the power of **Linear Programming** through the **PuLP** library, this project addresses real-world constraints faced by manufacturing units aiming for both efficiency and sustainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

In the competitive manufacturing landscape, balancing production efficiency with environmental responsibility is crucial. This project focuses on:

- **Optimizing Operating Hours:** Determining the optimal running hours for different production lines to achieve desired production targets.
- **Emissions Management:** Ensuring that the factory operations stay within the specified emission limits to promote environmental sustainability.
- **Decision Making Under Uncertainty:** Utilizing linear programming to make informed decisions despite uncertain variables and constraints.

## üìù How It Works

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - **Maximum Allowable Weekly Emissions (units):** Enter the upper limit for emissions your factory can produce weekly.
   - **Maximum Total Running Hours per Week:** Specify the total hours your production lines can operate each week.

2. **Optimization Process:**
   - The app utilizes the PuLP library to solve the linear programming problem, determining the optimal running hours for each production line to maximize output without exceeding emission and running hour constraints.

3. **View Results:**
   - Upon clicking the "Optimize Production" button, the app displays the optimal operating hours for each production line, the total production achieved, and verifies that all constraints are satisfied.
